We release anatomical fiducial (AFID) data on a subset (n=30) of the humman connectome project. 

This subset consists of 30 unrelated healthy subjects (age: 21-52; 15 female and 15 male) chosen from the Human Connectome Project dataset (HCP). All scans were T1-weighted MR volumes with 1 mm voxels acquired on a 3-T scanner. 

Data were provided by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.
